## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

**MCU Requirements:**

USP contains source code example for the STMicroelectronics STM32L476 Nucleo board, however, it can be easily ported to other MCUs. The following MCU features are required:

**Architecture:**
- 32-bit native operation (no specific CPU core needed)
- Little-endian byte order
- Software MCU reset

**Memory Requirements:**
- Varies significantly by application and enabled features
- **Reference:** `periodical_uplink` example on STM32L476 + LR2021 (compiled with `-Os` MinSizeRel):
  - Region: IN_865, CLASS B: ON, Relay TX: ON, FUOTA: ON, CSMA: OFF
  - Flash: ~143KB, RAM: ~18KB
- Actual usage depends on your application code and enabled LBM features

**Required Peripherals:**
- **SPI:** For radio communication (full-duplex master, 8-bit transfers, MISO, MOSI, SCK, NSS)
- **Timer:** 100μs resolution or better (In LoRaWAN, Timer accuracy compensation is possible by widening the reception windows)
- **GPIOs:** Interrupt-capable GPIO for radio events, control pins as required by radio (RESET, BUSY, IRQs)
- **Non-volatile Storage:** for modem state storage and if application requires context persistence
- **Entropy Source:** hardware or software

**Detailed LoRa Basics Modem Requirements:**
Note that reliable Class A LoRaWAN communication can be obtained without any major time constraints on the MCU oscillator, or the oscillator used to clock the devices that implement the time-related LoRa Basics Modem HAL functions.
To compensate for time-related oscillator frequency errors, calling the smtc_modem_set_crystal_error_ppm() modem API function with an appropriate value is sufficient.
This results in a widening of the LoRaWAN reception window and increased power consumption.
In the case of Class B, however, it is desirable to be able to remain synchronized with the beacon over relatively long time intervals, even if beacons are sometimes not received due to poor RF conditions.
In this case, it is recommended to use an accurate crystal oscillator to clock the devices used to implement the time-related LoRa Basics Modem HAL functions.

In certain situations, such as the use of GNSS reception with the LR11xx, a transceiver TCXO is required. When using GNSS advanced scan on the LR11xx, the TCXO must have a relatively fast settling time, and the 32.768 kHz crystal oscillator must have 20ppm accuracy at 25 degrees.

### System Design Considerations

There are numerous requirements and options to consider when developing a device that implements USP and/or LoRaWAN.

It is important to consider the transceiver and timer interrupt behavior and configuration. The LoRa Basics Modem is designed to use a specific transceiver DIO line as the radio interrupt source. For SX126x, this is the DIO1 line, and for LR11xx, this is the DIO9 line.
Two principal interrupt sources interact with USP: a timer interrupt, and a radio interrupt.
The system interrupt priorities must be configured in such a way that the timer and radio interrupts do not nest or interrupt each another.

Therefore, when designing hardware that will run USP, it is recommended that the MCU GPIO lines selected for the transceiver's DIO interrupt request line do not share an MCU interrupt flag with other timing-critical hardware. If MCU interrupt flags are shared, it may not always be possible to react immediately to interrupts originating from these other devices.

No radio operations over the transceiver SPI bus are performed during timer and radio interrupt service routines.
The Radio shall have an **exclusive SPI controller**.
See reference implementation in `examples/modem_pinout.h` for interrupt pin assignments for your radio

**Reference - GPIO Function Example:**

```c
// Reference: examples/smtc_hal_l4/smtc_hal_gpio.c (STM32L4)
void hal_gpio_set_value(const hal_gpio_pin_names_t pin, const uint32_t value) {
    ...

```

## PART 2: MCU-to-Radio Pin Mapping

Define GPIO pin assignments for your board.

**Reference:** `examples/modem_pinout.h`

**Required Pin Definitions:**
- SPI pins: MOSI, MISO, SCLK, NSS
- Radio control: RESET, BUSY
- Radio interrupt: DIOX (interrupt-capable GPIO)

**Note:** Pin assignments in `modem_pinout.h` show MCU GPIO assignments. The actual radio DIO pin (e.g., DIO1, DIO8, DIO9) used depends on the radio family and is configured in the radio HAL/BSP.

## PART 3: Radio BSP Configuration (Custom Radio Boards Only)

Configure board-specific radio settings based on your hardware schematic. For the Semtech LR2021, follow the [**Semtech LR2021 Reference Design**](https://www.semtech.com/products/wireless-rf/lora-plus/lr2021).

**Reference Implementation:** `examples/radio_hal/ral_{radio}_bsp.c` (shows how STM32L476 configures BSP)
**Function Definitions:** `smtc_rac_lib/smtc_ral/src/ral_{radio}_bsp.h` (defines required BSP functions)

**What to configure:**
- Power regulator type (DCDC or LDO) & consumption configuration
- RF switch configuration
- Clock source (XTAL or TCXO)
- Keep radio-specific parameters (TX power tables, calibration) from reference

If your RF shield hardware **matches the LR2021 reference design**, you can **reuse the existing power PA table** `XXX_PA_XX_CFG_TABLE` provided in BSP files : `examples\radio_hal\lr20xx_pa_pwr_cfg.h`.

**Radio HAL files:** `examples/radio_hal/{radio}_hal.c` - Include in build without modification

**Note:** The `smtc_rac_lib/smtc_ral/src/` folder also contains RAL core implementation files (e.g., `ral_sx126x.c`, `ral_lr11xx.c`) - these are part of the library and should **not be modified**.

**Details:** See [Radio Driver HAL Implementation](#radio-driver-hal-implementation) and [RAL BSP Implementation](#ral-bsp-implementation) sections below for complete details.

**For Standard Shields:** Use reference BSP without modification.

## Implementation Details

### Radio Driver HAL Implementation

The USP software depends on Semtech's radio driver, which, in turn, requires a radio driver HAL implementation.
A brief description of the necessary steps for this implementation follows.

The HAL implementation must provide platform-specific read, write, reset, and wake-up implementations.

- Radio driver API functions call the HAL implementation to perform the actual reset, wake, and communication operations needed by the driver.
- For the `LR20xx`, these functions are documented in [lr20xx_hal.h](/smtc_rac_lib/radio_drivers/lr20xx_driver/inc/lr20xx_hal.h).
- For the `LR11xx`, these functions are documented in [lr11xx_hal.h](/smtc_rac_lib/radio_drivers/lr11xx_driver/src/lr11xx_hal.h).
- For the `SX126x`, these functions are documented in [sx126x_hal.h](/smtc_rac_lib/radio_drivers/sx126x_driver/src/sx126x_hal.h).

All radio driver API functions take a 'const void* context' argument:

- This argument is opaque to both the radio driver and USP software.
- It may be used by the HAL implementer to differentiate between different transceivers, which makes it easy to communicate with several radios inside the same application.
- Driver API functions do not use the context argument but pass it directly to the HAL implementation.

The USP software imposes a specific requirement on the radio driver HAL implementation:

- If a radio driver API function is called while the transceiver is in sleep mode, the HAL implementation must properly wake the transceiver and wait until it is ready before initiating any SPI communication.
- This typically requires that the HAL keeps track of whether the radio is awake or asleep, potentially by monitoring any commands sent to the transceiver to detect the SetSleep command.
- For a concrete LR20xx example, see the file: [lr20xx_hal.c](/examples/radio_hal/lr20xx_hal.c).
- For a concrete LR11xx example, see the file: [lr11xx_hal.c](/examples/radio_hal/lr11xx_hal.c).
- For a concrete SX126x example, see the file: [sx126x_hal.c](/examples/radio_hal/sx126x_hal.c).

When compiling the radio driver HAL implementation, it is necessary to add the radio driver source directory to the include path.
For example, for LR11xx:

- `smtc_rac_lib/radio_drivers/lr11xx_driver/src`

---

### RAL BSP Implementation

When porting the USP software to a new radio + MCU implementation, a Radio Abstraction Layer (RAL) board support package (BSP) implementation is necessary.
A brief description of the necessary steps follows.

The RAL provides radio-independent API functions that are similar to those provided by each radio driver.
The RAL, and a complementary layer called the RALF, are described in the following header functions:

- [ral.h](/smtc_rac_lib/smtc_ral/src/ral.h)
- [ralf.h](/smtc_rac_lib/smtc_ralf/src/ralf.h)

The RAL requires the implementer to define a few BSP API functions for the selected transceiver, by providing platform or radio-specific information to the RAL.

- For the `LR20xx`, these functions are described in [ral_lr20xx_bsp.h](/smtc_rac_lib/smtc_ral/src/ral_lr20xx_bsp.h).
- For the `LR11xx`, these functions are described in [ral_lr11xx_bsp.h](/smtc_rac_lib/smtc_ral/src/ral_lr11xx_bsp.h).
- For the `SX126x`, these functions are described in [ral_sx126x_bsp.h](/smtc_rac_lib/smtc_ral/src/ral_sx126x_bsp.h).

- An LR20xx sample implementation is in the file [ral_lr20xx_bsp.c](/examples/radio_hal/ral_lr20xx_bsp.c).
- An LR11xx sample implementation is in the file [ral_lr11xx_bsp.c](/examples/radio_hal/ral_lr11xx_bsp.c).
- An SX126x sample implementation is in the file [ral_sx126x_bsp.c](/examples/radio_hal/ral_sx126x_bsp.c).

The role of the 'const void* context' variable is described in previous section. It is typically used to store radio-specific information, but depending on the radio driver BSP implementation, it may be NULL if a single transceiver is used.
When compiling the RAL BSP implementation, it is necessary to add the radio driver source directory and the RAL source directory to the include path. For example, for LR11xx:

- `smtc_rac_lib/radio_drivers/lr11xx_driver/src`
- `smtc_rac_lib/smtc_ral/src`

### SMTC Modem HAL Implementation

Porting the USP software to a new MCU architecture requires implementing the modem Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) API commands described by the prototypes in the header file [smtc_modem_hal.h](/protocols/lbm_lib/smtc_modem_hal/smtc_modem_hal.h).
Among other things, these API implementations define how timing information is provided to the USP, how random numbers are generated, and how data is stored in non-volatile memory.
If a TCXO is used on the radio part, its startup timing behavior should be specified in the RAL BSP implementation, and the documentation of the smtc_modem_hal_start_radio_tcxo(), smtc_modem_hal_stop_radio_tcxo(), and smtc_modem_hal_get_radio_tcxo_startup_delay_ms() functions, should be consulted.
Logging macros are defined in [smtc_modem_hal_dbg_trace.h](/protocols/lbm_lib/smtc_modem_core/logging/smtc_modem_hal_dbg_trace.h). In case the OS has a macro-based logging implementation, the HAL can provide its own header, by removing the `logging` directory from the include list.

An example of implementation on STM32L476 and STM32L073 can be found in [smtc_modem_hal.c](/examples/smtc_modem_hal/smtc_modem_hal.c)

The following sections provide the list and more details on the different modem HAL APIs.

### Trace management related functions

The HAL can provide its own trace macros by:

- removing the `smtc_modem_core/logging` from the include list

#### `void smtc_modem_hal_crashlog_restore( uint8_t* crash_string, uint8_t* crash_string_length )`

**Brief**:
Retrieve the modem crash log from non-volatile memory.
On most MCUs, RAM is preserved upon reset, so it may be possible to use RAM for this purpose.
In case Device Management service is running, if status is true the crashlog will be sent automatically after joining the network.

**Parameters**:

|       |       |       |
|---    |---    |---    |
|[out]|crash_string|Crashlog string to be restored|
|[out]|crash_string_length|Crashlog string length|

#### `void smtc_modem_hal_crashlog_set_status( bool available )`

**Brief**:
Store the modem crash log status to non-volatile memory. True indicates that a crash log has been stored and is available for retrieval.
On most MCUs, RAM is preserved upon reset, so it may be possible to use RAM for this purpose.
This function is not called by USP directly but the recommendation is to call it in `smtc_modem_hal_on_panic()`implementation.

In case Device Management service is running, if status is true the crashlog will be sent automatically after joining the network.

**Parameters**:

|       |       |       |
|---    |---    |---    |
|[in]|available|True if a crashlog is available, false otherwise|

#### `bool smtc_modem_hal_crashlog_get_status( void )`

**Brief**:
Get the modem crash log status from non-volatile memory.
**Return**:
The crash log status, as previously written using `smtc_modem_hal_set_crashlog_status()`.
In case Device Management service is running, if status is true the crashlog will be sent automatically after joining the network.

### Store and Forward related functions (optional)

#### `uint16_t smtc_modem_hal_store_and_forward_get_number_of_pages( void )`

**Brief**:
Return the number of reserved pages in flash for the Store and Forward service.
At least 3 pages are needed for the service.
**Return**:
The number of reserved pages

#### `uint16_t smtc_modem_hal_flash_get_page_size( void )`

**Brief**:
Gives the size of a flash page in bytes
**Return**:
The size of a flash page.

### RTOS compatibility related functions

#### `void smtc_modem_hal_user_lbm_irq( void )`

**Brief**:
This function is called by the LBM stack on each LBM interruption (radio interrupt or low-power timer interrupt). It could be convenient in the case of an RTOS implementation to notify the thread that manages the LBM stack

## Testing & Validation

### Phase 1: Porting Tests (**REQUIRED**)

**Application:** `porting_tests`
**Source:** `examples/main_examples/main_porting_tests.c`

This validates your HAL implementation.

**Expected output:**
```
porting_test_spi : OK
porting_test_radio_irq : OK
porting_test_get_time : OK
porting_test_timer_irq : OK
porting_test_stop_timer : OK
porting_test_disable_enable_irq : OK
porting_test_random : OK
porting_test_config_rx_radio : OK
porting_test_config_tx_radio : OK
porting_test_sleep_ms : OK
porting_test_timer_irq_low_power : OK
```

**If any test fails:** Fix that HAL function before proceeding.

### Phase 2: LoRaWAN Application Test

**Application:** `periodical_uplink`
**Source:** `examples/main_examples/main_periodical_uplink.c`

Configure LoRaWAN credentials:

**Reference:** `examples/main_examples/example_options.h`

```c
#define USER_LORAWAN_DEVICE_EUI { 0x00, ..., 0x01 }
#define USER_LORAWAN_JOIN_EUI   { 0x00, ..., 0x01 }
#define USER_LORAWAN_APP_KEY    { 0x00, ..., 0x01 }
#define MODEM_EXAMPLE_REGION    SMTC_MODEM_REGION_EU_868
```

**Expected output:**
```
Event received: RESET
Event received: JOINED
Event received: TXDONE
```
